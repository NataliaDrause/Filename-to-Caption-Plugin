# Filename to Caption Plugin for WordPress
This plugin will convert image filenames to text that can be added as Caption, Title and Description of the media file.

Additionally the caption can be displayed as `<figcaption>` element under images in the posts.

The plugin targets only Post content images added with the Image blocks.

### Recommended format for filenames
Separate words by dashes, underscores or spaces in the filenames of the images.

#### Examples:

 - `this-is-my-caption.jpg`
 - `this_is_also_my_caption.png`
 - `and another caption.png`
